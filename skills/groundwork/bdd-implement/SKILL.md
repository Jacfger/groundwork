# BDD Implement

## Core Principle

**Validate behavior, not implementation.** Tests should confirm *what the system does* from the user's perspective, not *how the code is structured internally.*

- **UI work:** Visual inspection before/after (screenshots, accessibility snapshots)
- **Non-UI work:** Integration or end-to-end tests that exercise real behavior paths
- **Never:** Unit tests that mock internals to verify code structure

## When to Use

**MANDATORY** — invoke this skill in these cases:

- Immediately after a PRD is approved, before any implementation begins
- After `interview` for small changes (<1 day) — interview output is the spec
- Any feature that changes observable behavior
- When scoping implementation work into parallel execution waves

**Do NOT use for bugs.** Bugs go through `diagnose` instead — it owns the fix and regression test. If a bug went through `diagnose`, do NOT also invoke `bdd-implement`.

**You do not have a choice.** If a PRD has been approved and implementation is starting, this skill must be followed.

## Task Graph

Before implementing, decompose work into a **task dependency graph** for maximum parallelism:

1. **List atomic tasks** — each with a clear "done" definition
2. **Map dependencies** — hard ordering (A must finish before B) vs soft preferences
3. **Assign waves** — Wave 0 has no predecessors; Wave k requires all predecessors in waves < k
4. **Identify critical path** — longest chain that determines total time
5. **Flag resource conflicts** — tasks touching the same file/service must serialize despite parallel eligibility

Execute waves in order; **within a wave, launch ALL tasks in parallel via the builtin `task` tool with `agent: "coder"`**. Do not serialize tasks that can run concurrently — this is a hard requirement, not a suggestion.

## Parallel Coder Delegation

When launching a wave, send all wave tasks to `coder` agents simultaneously:

```
# Good: parallel launch of Wave 0
task(description="Implement auth endpoint", prompt="...", agent="coder")
task(description="Add database schema", prompt="...", agent="coder")
task(description="Write integration tests", prompt="...", agent="coder")

# Bad: sequential delegation — never do this
task(...) → wait → task(...) → wait → ...
```

Each `coder` prompt must be **fully self-contained**: include file paths, requirements, acceptance criteria, and any context the coder needs. The coder has no shared context with you.

## Workflow

### 1. Capture Before State

- **Web:** `playwright_browser_snapshot` + `playwright_browser_take_screenshot` → `before-<description>.png`
- **macOS native:** XCUITest accessibility snapshot + `screenshot()` → `before-<description>.png`
- **Non-UI:** Construct/reuse integration/e2e tests to capture baseline behavior. Note what passes/fails.

### 2. Build Task Graph & Launch Wave 0

Decompose work (see Task Graph above). Launch all Wave 0 tasks to `coder` agents in parallel via `task`. Do not begin Wave 1 until all Wave 0 tasks complete.

### 3. Execute Remaining Waves

After each wave completes (all task results retrieved), launch the next wave in parallel. Update `todowrite` state after each wave.

### 4. Capture After State

Same tools as Step 1. Label: `after-<description>.png` or after-state test results.

### 5. Validate

- **UI:** Side-by-side comparison — does visual output match requirement? Any unexpected changes? Accessibility tree correct?
- **Non-UI:** Do integration/e2e tests pass? Does observed behavior match the requirement?
- **Both:** If unexpected changes — stop, diagnose, fix, re-validate.

### 6. Completion Gate

Invoke `advisor-gate` with: before state, after state, what changed, what requirement is met.

**Do not declare done without this gate. This step is non-negotiable.**
